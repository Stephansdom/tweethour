NAME

    tweethour.pl - tweets the hour like a church clock

USAGE

        ./tweethour.pl mytwittername mytwitterpassword

    or

        ./tweethour.pl mytwittername mytwitterpassword BLING

    or

        ./tweethour.sh mytwittername mytwitterpassword

    tweethour.pl will DONG like a church clock by default. If you provide
    the third command line argument "BLING", it will BLING instead of DONG.

    There's also a shell script version (tweethour.sh) which has no
    possibility to change the DONG. This script's source comes without
    readability.
