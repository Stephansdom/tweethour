=head1 NAME

tweethour.pl - tweets the hour like a church clock

=head1 USAGE

    ./tweethour.pl mytwittername mytwitterpassword

or

    ./tweethour.pl mytwittername mytwitterpassword BLING

or

    ./tweethour.sh mytwittername mytwitterpassword

tweethour.pl will DONG like a church clock by default. If you provide the third command line argument C<BLING>, it will BLING instead of DONG.

There's also a shell script version (tweethour.sh) which has no possibility to change the DONG. This script's source comes without readability.

=head1 SETTING UP tweethour FOR YOUR FAVOURITE CHURCH

First, you have to create a twitter account like @lambertikirche, then clone this git repo (git://github.com/memowe/tweethour.git) and create a cron job that fire's tweethour.pl or tweethour.sh for your church's twitter account every hour like this:

    # m h  dom mon dow   command
      0 *  *   *   *     /home/memowe/tweethour/tweethour.sh name password

Done.
